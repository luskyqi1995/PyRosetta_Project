### Pseudo Code

"""
import pyrosetta

import pose from pdb

make PackedPose object for parallelizaation
clone pose for "starting pose"

make a backrub ensemble of WT, relaxed
 
label each backrub structure 
 
pass the 50 structures into a "mutate" function, which makes 50 structure of the same mutation, starting from the
    50 WT backrubbed structures
 at this point, you should have 50 structures for each point mutation tested, plus the WT (50 structures)


for each mutation:
    for each backrub structure:
        minimize


now we have n_mutations objects with 50 poses, each pose can be scored

calculate a ddG of score per pose

calculate an average ddG of mutation compared to wt average ddG

store in a pandas dataframe

make a heatmap
